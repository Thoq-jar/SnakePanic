# This snake program can and will cause a kernel panic on your computer.

Prerequisites:
- Love 2d game engine
- Unix Based OS
- Clang or GCC Compiler installed


To run execute this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thoq-jar/Untitled.git && cd SnakePanic && cc crash.c -o kaboom && cc lag.c -o boom && sudo love src/
```

- On Linux / BSD you should be good to go!
- On macOS I cannot guarantee that it will panic, but it does have code to lag the system and possibly panic.
