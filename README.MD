# This snake program can and will cause a kernel panic on your computer.
- If you are on macOS you need to disable System Intercity Protection (SIP): `csrutil disable` and then reboot, we recommend enabling SIP after you are done!
- On Linux / BSD you should be good to go!

Make sure to run `sudo love src/` otherwise it won't be able to trigger the kernel panic!
